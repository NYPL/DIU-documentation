    1. Turn on computer to allow monitor to warm up
</p>
<p>
    2. Turn on Profoto power pack
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
    a. For standard reflective digitization: keep the lights at the same output
    power, match the height &amp; angle of the lights, as well as the distance
    to the edges of copy stand tabletop
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px">
    i. Light height: approx. 75” (to pin)
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px">
    ii. Angle of lights: approx. 70 degrees (or 20 degrees - depending on
    orientation of angle-finder)
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px">
    iii. Approximate distance to edge of tabletop: approx. 50 inches
</p>
<p>
    3. Turn on Phase One Digital Back
</p>
<p>
    4. Open Capture One software
</p>
<p>
    5. Open Schneider Shutter Control
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
    a. Except for Bay 3, which uses manual controls with the Rollei Lens
    Control S)

    />
</p>
<p>
    6. Sign in to Trello and find card for materials/project to be worked on,
    within “Materials Received”
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
    a. i.e. “Century_Company_Box_104”
</p>
<p>
    7. Move Trello card from “Materials Received” to the camera bay where
    digitization will take place (i.e. Bay 3 Rollei P45)
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
    a. Add yourself as a member to the card
</p>
<p>
    8. Sign in to MMS and open Work Order from link within the Trello card
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
    a. You should be directed to the Work Order that matches the materials
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
    b. If not, do a search for “Century_Company_Box_104” under the Work Orders
    tab
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px">
    i. Update work order link within Trello Card if needed
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
    c. Add yourself as photographer (by clicking “edit” under Photographer)
</p>
<p>
    9. Create a new Session in Capture One with name of Work Order
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
    a. Use no spaces, but use underscores and add your initials to the
    beginning (i.e. PR_Century_Company_Box_104)
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
    b. This naming convention will aid in smooth uploads to the server, as well
    as the repo check workflow - allowing photographers to easily determine the
    sessions owner
</p>
<p>
    10. Set-up captures within Capture One based on resolution specified for
    each project (i.e. Century Company records worked on across various
    workstations use a similar PPI/Resolution of approximately 520ppi)
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
    a. Choose appropriate background (in the case of Century, we use gray)
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
    b. Confirm that ISO is set to the “base ISO” for particular Phase One
    digital back (unless otherwise decided upon or noted)
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px">
    i. Bay 3 Rollei P45 uses ISO 100
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 80px">
    ii. Note: BC100/Book Scanner with P40+ backs use ISO 200 (for increased
    shutter speed)
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
    c. Under Base Characteristics, choose Linear Scientific (choose Linear
    Response on older digital backs - such as Bay 3 Rollei P45)
</p>

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
    d. Set Process Recipe to: U File (so that ICC profile is set for: embedded
    camera profile)
</p>

    e. Confirm that Sharpening uses DIU standard: Amount = 100, Radius = 1.0,
    Threshold = 1
</p>

    />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px"> 
    f. Use Golden Thread target to initially determine PPI/Resolution (and aid
    for initial focus)
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
    g. Use 5-point focus aids for fine tuning, as needed (graphite pencil
    patterns on white paper provides nice texture and contrast for focus aids)
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
    h. Create LCC (once focus and lighting is set)
</p>
<p align="center">

</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
    i. Set white point on target, with a RGB readout visible (RGB values for
    white point should hit 240, + or - 3 points)
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
    j. Set white balance (RGB values fall within 1 point of each other in all
    three channels when measured on patch 15 or 16)
</p>

    11. If working with a two-monitor workstation, it can be helpful to use the
    second monitor for: viewing the Work Order in MMS, for the Schneider
    Shutter Control window or having an additional Viewer window in Capture One
    for 100% viewing to check focus or for page number reference, etc.
</p>
<p>
    12. You should now be set-up for the basic capture workflow for loose
    manuscript materials
</p>
<p>
    13. Enjoy the process and fine tune the workflow to what works best for
    you!
</p>
<p>
    <em>Note</em>
    : If you encounter materials of interest that you would like to share with
    your DIU colleagues and/or have added to monthly Digital report highlights
    by the Manager, please process out anywhere from 1 - 10 captures as JPEGS
    (ICC profile set to: sRGB) with the long dimension set to 2000 pixels
    (using the “jpegs” Process Recipe)
