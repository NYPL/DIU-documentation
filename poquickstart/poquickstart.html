    <strong>Summary</strong>
    : This document provides a step-by-step guide to what to look for when
    approaching a Public Order digitization request. We hope to ensure that we
    meet both the needs of the patron, while also covering our internal image
    quality specifications for access and long term preservation.

        If not, it’s helpful to always do a thorough check of the paperwork that
        accompanies the material --- or that’s attached as a PDF to the Trello card
        </li>
        <li class="text-large list-spacing">
        Sometimes only a single page Cover Sheet from Permissions is available
        </li>
        <li class="text-large list-spacing">
        Other times, there may be additional pages attached that include the
        online request - “NYPL Licensing Application Form” with notes by either Tom
        or Andrea from Permissions (referenced in detail below and in PDF in
        archived card    <a href="https://trello.com/c/vOIyAyMq/2224-po57275-lhg-lsc">here</a>)

        If doing LHG - NYC Views (best to reshoot the overall mounted page,
        recto/verso) to replace previous versions, in addition to the “Detail view”
        - as referenced on the work order screenshot below.

    <strong>General rule of thumb, fill the frame as much as possible</strong>
    </li>
    <ul>
        <li class="text-large list-spacing">
        Rotate digital back vertically if needed - for lighting, maximum sensor
        coverage and/or option to use smaller target
        </li>
        <li class="text-large list-spacing">
        Filling the frame will hopefully mean less reshoot requests in the future
        by patrons and will also mean we can confidently say that we provided the
        highest resolution we could, given our current equipment
        </li>
        <li class="text-large list-spacing">
        At times, it may be make sense for items with a large area of paper
        border on a print (i.e. a 4x6” photographic image or etching - printed on
        an 11x14” paper), to shoot the entire print (recto/verso for preservation)
        and then create a “detail view” for the item to fulfill the patrons pixel
        dimension request for the tighter shot to the image area edge
        </li>
        </ul>
    <li class="text-large list-spacing">
    <strong>If reshooting a photographic print for example, at a higher ppi and no
    verso was previously digitized, let’s shoot the verso as well</strong>
    </li>
    <li class="text-large list-spacing">
    <strong>Digitize the entire item whenever we have the bandwidth and time to do
    so
    </strong>
    <em>(and there are not rights restrictions are in place)</em>
    <strong></strong>
    </li>
    <ul>
        <li class="text-large list-spacing">
        For example, where pg. 2 and 3 of a manuscript is requested and there are
        only 4 pages total, we should try to shoot all pages for future DC
        reference and preservation of the given material. Especially beneficial for
        public domain items. (i.e. <a href="http://metadata.nypl.org/work_orders/48423">PO 57294</a>)    <strong></strong>

    <strong>Material being requested as a ‘Book Scan’ and their captures</strong>
    </li>
    <ul>
        <li class="text-large list-spacing">
        Ideally Book Scan requests should only have the item added to the Work
        Order, with no associated captures created by Permissions or metadata staff
        </li>
        <li class="text-large list-spacing">
        DIU photographers will then create the needed captures after the item has
        been digitized, based on the final capture count and then populate ID’s so
        they are sequential
        </li>

    <strong>Metadata issue or an item needs correction, items added, etc.</strong>
    </li>
    <ul>
        <li class="text-large list-spacing">
        Aya (Aygul Malkeyeva) from MSU can assist in needed adjustments to
        collection items, or adding necessary items (if for example, we decide to
        shoot an entire book and/or need to have items added to better match ingest
        from TMS database, etc)<strong></strong>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <li class="text-large list-spacing">
    <strong>Changes in ID’s for any given material - from what may be noted on the
        Cover Sheet</strong>
    </li>
    <ul>
        <li class="text-large list-spacing">
        For example, if we have a request for 4 pages from a bound item (that has
        already had the ID’s created on the Work Order by Permissions), but we then
        decide that we have the time to digitize the entire item - with the ‘book
        scan’ approach. In this care, it’s easier from a metadata standpoint (and
        with Capture One renaming), to delete those capture ID’s and have them
        remade so that the ID range is sequential.
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li class="text-large list-spacing">
            When this is done, let’s be sure we make a comment on the Trello card
            that alerts the Permissions staff that they will need to update their
            database accordingly - so that the correct images are delivered.

        <li class="text-large list-spacing">
        It is usually the case that this is worked out beforehand with
        Permissions, but these are often best delivered on an external hard drive,
        which is supplied by the patron (i.e. Google Cultural Institute request of
        1300+ West Side Story negs &amp; prints - U &amp; S files delivered =
        770GB)
        </li>
        <li class="text-large list-spacing">
        Just keep in mind that we’ll want to make sure these files are
        transferred to necessary hard drive after QC and before session deletion

    <strong>
        When in doubt, ask Eric, Pete or Steven for clarification. There are
        times when we may need to reach out to Permissions (Tom or Andrea) for
        feedback and, if needed, have them follow-up with the patron for
        clarification.
