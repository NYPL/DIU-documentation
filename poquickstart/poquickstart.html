    <strong>Summary</strong>
    : This document provides a step-by-step guide to what to look for when
    approaching a Public Order digitization request. We hope to ensure that we
    meet both the needs of the patron, while also covering our internal image
    quality specifications for access and long term preservation.

    ● <strong>Due date (Normal, Rush or Super Rush turnaround time)</strong>
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing indent">
    ○ Please allow enough time for shooting/processing, QC and ingest
    through RTG to allow the Permissions staff (Andrea Felder or Tom Lisanti)
    to deliver on time
</p>

    <strong>
        Check to make sure the correct material is with correct cover sheet
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing indent">
    ○ Is every book or item accounted for?
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing tab">
    ●
    <strong>
        Keep the Permissions Cover Sheet with the material through the various
        steps of the process
    </strong>

    ○ Once packed up for return, paperwork can be added to the stack of PO’s

        Add yourself as photographer as soon as Work Order is opened for the
        first time

    PPI - Pixel Resolution (‘Detail Views’, Etc.):
</p><br>
<p class="text-large text-spacing tab">
    ● <strong>Are there specific pixel resolution needs by the patron?</strong>
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing indent">
    ○ Usually these requests are noted within the “Special Instructions:” on
    the front of the cover sheet and/or within the “Additional comments:” on
    the Trello card
</p>
<p align="center">

        <img class="img-fluid" src="images/image7.jpg"/>
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing indent">
    ○ If not, it’s helpful to always do a thorough check of the paperwork that
    accompanies the material --- or that’s attached as a PDF to the Trello card
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing indent">
    ○ Sometimes only a single page Cover Sheet from Permissions is available
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing indent">
    ○ Other times, there may be additional pages attached that include the
    online request - “NYPL Licensing Application Form” with notes by either Tom
    or Andrea from Permissions (referenced in detail below and in PDF in
archived card    <a href="https://trello.com/c/vOIyAyMq/2224-po57275-lhg-lsc">here</a>)
<p align="center">  <img class="img-fluid" src="images/image4.jpg"/>
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing indent">
    ○ If doing LHG - NYC Views (best to reshoot the overall mounted page,
    recto/verso) to replace previous versions, in addition to the “Detail view”
    - as referenced on the work order screenshot below.</p>
<p align="center"> <img class="img-fluid"  src="images/image8.jpg"/>
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing tab">
●    <strong>General rule of thumb, fill the frame as much as possible</strong>
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing indent">
    ○ Rotate digital back vertically if needed - for lighting, maximum sensor
    coverage and/or option to use smaller target
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing indent">
    ○ Filling the frame will hopefully mean less reshoot requests in the future
    by patrons and will also mean we can confidently say that we provided the
    highest resolution we could, given our current equipment
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing indent">
    ○ At times, it may be make sense for items with a large area of paper
    border on a print (i.e. a 4x6” photographic image or etching - printed on
    an 11x14” paper), to shoot the entire print (recto/verso for preservation)
    and then create a “detail view” for the item to fulfill the patrons pixel
    dimension request for the tighter shot to the image area edge
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing tab">
    ●
    <strong>
        If reshooting a photographic print for example, at a higher ppi and no
        verso was previously digitized, let’s shoot the verso as well
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing tab">
    ●
    <strong>
        Digitize the entire item whenever we have the bandwidth and time to do
        so
    </strong>
    <em>(and there are not rights restrictions are in place)</em>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing indent">
    ○ For example, where pg. 2 and 3 of a manuscript is requested and there are
    only 4 pages total, we should try to shoot all pages for future DC
    reference and preservation of the given material. Especially beneficial for
public domain items. (i.e.<a href="http://metadata.nypl.org/work_orders/48423">PO57294</a>)    <strong></strong>

    <strong>
        Double-page spreads from ‘Book Scans’ on a copy stand (not done on
        BC100)
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing indent">
    ○ As one shot (there may be occasional exceptions, but we’d like to try to
    capture spreads when possible)

    ●
    <strong>
        Material being requested as a ‘Book Scan’ and their captures
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing indent">
    ○ Ideally Book Scan requests should only have the item added to the Work
    Order, with no associated captures created by Permissions or metadata staff
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing indent">
    ○ DIU photographers will then create the needed captures after the item has
    been digitized, based on the final capture count and then populate ID’s so
    they are sequential
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing tab">
    ●
    <strong>
        Metadata issue or an item needs correction, items added, etc.
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing indent">
    ○ Aya (Aygul Malkeyeva) from MSU can assist in needed adjustments to
    collection items, or adding necessary items (if for example, we decide to
    shoot an entire book and/or need to have items added to better match ingest
    from TMS database, etc)<strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing tab">
    ●
    <strong>
        Changes in ID’s for any given material - from what may be noted on the
        Cover Sheet
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing indent">
    ○ For example, if we have a request for 4 pages from a bound item (that has
    already had the ID’s created on the Work Order by Permissions), but we then
    decide that we have the time to digitize the entire item - with the ‘book
    scan’ approach. In this care, it’s easier from a metadata standpoint (and
    with Capture One renaming), to delete those capture ID’s and have them
    remade so that the ID range is sequential.
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing indenttab">
    ■ When this is done, let’s be sure we make a comment on the Trello card
    that alerts the Permissions staff that they will need to update their
    database accordingly - so that the correct images are delivered.

    Book Scan QC &amp; PDF Creation:
</p><br>
<p class="text-large text-spacing tab">
    ● PDF creation now added to the QC process

<p class="text-large text-spacing tab">
    ● PDFmaker script should be available on all workstations

        PDF naming convention for single versus multiple books/volumes:
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing indent">
    ○ <em>A single book/volume: </em>
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing indenttab">
    ■ “NYPL Book Scan PO 57133.pdf”
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing indent">
    ○ <em>For multiple books/volumes, let’s create a PDF per book/volume:</em>
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing indenttab">
    ■ If there’s volume info, let’s default to using those:
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing indentindenttab">
    ● i.e. “NYPL Book Scan PO 57133 vol 2.pdf” &amp; NYPL Book Scan PO 57133
    vol 3-4”.pdf
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing indenttab">
    ■ If there is no volume info, let’s use:
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing indentindenttab">
    ● i.e. “NYPL Book Scan PO 57133 1of2.pdf” &amp; “NYPL Book Scan PO 57133
    2of2”.pdf
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing tab">
    ● If there are no corrections needed, simply open a Terminal window and
    type ‘pdfmaker’
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing indent">
    ○ Drag your server PO folder into the Terminal window and press [Return]
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing indent">
    ○ Jpegs will be generated, formed into a PDF, and automatically moved into
    the PDF Storage directory on the server
</p><br>
<p align="center">
    <img class="img-fluid" src="images/image9.jpg"/>
</p><br>
<p class="text-large text-spacing indent">
    ○ Add a similar comment to alert Andrea Felder that PDF is ready for
    delivery…
</p><br>
<p align="center" >
    <img class="img-fluid" src="images/image5.jpg"/>
</p><br>
<p class="text-large text-spacing indentindenttab">
    ■ Once PDF is delivered by Permissions, Andrea updates the folder with “-
    done AF” and moves it to the “NYPL Book Scan PO HOLD_temp” folder (if
    needed for redelivery or future access).
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing tab">
    ● After PDF is created and folder added to server location, the folder of U
    &amp; S files can be marked as usual with X’s for upload of to RTG
</p><br>
<p class="H3 text-spacing">
    OTHER ASPECTS TO KEEP IN MIND:
</p><br>
<p class="text-large text-spacing tab">
    ●
    <strong>
        Large quantity orders, where there are several hundred/thousands of
        images being requested as TIFF’s
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing indent">
    ○ It is usually the case that this is worked out beforehand with
    Permissions, but these are often best delivered on an external hard drive,
    which is supplied by the patron (i.e. Google Cultural Institute request of
    1300+ West Side Story negs &amp; prints - U &amp; S files delivered =
    770GB)
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing indent">
    ○ Just keep in mind that we’ll want to make sure these files are
    transferred to necessary hard drive after QC and before session deletion
    from local HD
</p><br>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    <strong>
        When in doubt, ask Eric, Pete or Steven for clarification. There are
        times when we may need to reach out to Permissions (Tom or Andrea) for
        feedback and, if needed, have them follow-up with the patron for
        clarification.
