    Overview
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    Image Get is a web application that offers a limited front-end view into
    the long-term Isilon storage that houses all access derivatives and
    archival master files created by DIU staff. Image Get displays the number
    and types of all derivatives present for a given file name and will deliver
    copies of S and U versions of files in the repository for staff use to a
    work share on Isilon Cluster D (ice.repo.nypl.org/ifs/ice/Staff).
</p><br>
<p class="H2 text-spacing">
    Logging In
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    To access Image Get, point your browser to:
    <a href="http://legacylair.nypl.org/wrm/imageget/">http://legacylair.nypl.org/wrm/imageget/</a>
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    Creating a new account can be done via the link below the Login button, but
    Image Get will still need to be added to your WRM account. Contact Angel
    Urena (<a href="mailto:angelurena@nypl.org">angelurena@nypl.org</a>) to
    have Image Get added to your account.
</p><br>
<p align="center">
    <img class="img-fluid" src="images/image6.png"/>
</p><br>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    If you already have an account, login using the credentials supplied
    through the WRM system. Be sure to keep track of your passwords, as the
    system will ask you to change frequently.
</p><br>
<p class="H2 text-spacing">
    Requesting Images
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    When you have successfully logged in to WRM, click through to Image Get
    where you will be given instructions to request single, multiple, or ranges
    of files by Image ID.
</p><br>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    <strong>How to request an image(s):</strong>
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    To request an Image please enter the IMAGE ID and click submit.
</p><br>
<p class="text-large text-spacing tab">
    <strong>
        To request multiple images please enter each image ID on a separate
        line:
    </strong>
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing indent">
    Example:
</p>
<p class="text-large no-spacing indent">
    123456
</p>
<p class="text-large no-spacing indent">
    654321
</p>
<p class="text-large no-spacing indent">
    789034
</p><br>
<p class="text-large text-spacing tab">
    <strong>You may use hyphens to specify a range:</strong>
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing indent">
    Example:
</p>
<p class="text-large no-spacing indent">
    100015
</p>
<p class="text-large no-spacing indent">
    100025-100034
</p>
<p class="text-large no-spacing indent">
    100045
</p><br>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    Single image and simple Image ID range requests can be entered according to
    the request instructions. However, if requesting multiple ranges or large
    numbers of non-consecutive IDs, it may be easier to copy all Capture IDs
    straight from a work order and reformat using a text editor to place each
    comma-separated ID on a new line.
</p><br>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    <em>To remove commas with Sublime Text: </em>
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    1. Go to a work order and click Copy all Capture IDs
</p><br>
<p>
    <img class="img-fluid" src="images/image4.png"/>
</p><br>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    2. Paste (command+v) into an empty sublime text document
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    3. Navigate to the find menu and choose “Replace”
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    4. Check to make sure that the regular expression option is enabled (button
    with .* next to Aa)
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    5. Find all commas followed by a space (, ) and replace with a new line (
    \n), click Replace All

</p><br>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    <strong>Pending Requests</strong>
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    Images that have been recently requested and are still being copied to the
    Staff folder for retrieval by staff are listed with thumbnails under
    Pending Requests.
</p><br>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    <strong>Active Requests</strong>
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    Images that have been requested in the last 3 days are listed with
    thumbnails under Active Requests. When a request is active, S and U tif
    variants are available in the Staff folder.
</p><br>
<p class="H2 text-spacing">
    Request Results
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    When desired IDs have been entered into the search field, press the submit
    button to go to the results page.
</p><br>
<p align="center">
        <img class="img-fluid" src="images/image5.png"/>
</p><br>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    After submitting a desired Image ID range, Image Get will display the
    following information about your requested IDs:
</p>
<ul class="text-large text-spacing">
  <li>A thumbnail preview (T derivative) which will reveal a larger preview
    when clicked through (W derivative)</li>
  <li>Type and number of derivatives available</li>
  <li>Pixel dimensions of archival master file (U file), if available</li>
  <li>Checksum info</li>
  <li>Struc ID (if available from legacy metadata system Hades)</li>
</ul>

    <strong>Currently Available or Pending</strong>
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    If your Image Get search comes back with a result that a given Image ID is
    currently available or is pending, the file has been delivered to the Staff
    folder some time in the last 3 days and should be accessible there. You
    will be unable to verify the individual derivative breakdown until the 3
    day period has expired unless you direct your browser to the image server (
    <a href="http://images.nypl.org/?id=57034976&amp;t=w&amp;d=0">
        http://images.nypl.org/?id=57034976&amp;t=w&amp;d=0
    </a> ), replacing w with the derivative type you’re looking for).
</p><br>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    <strong>Not In Archive</strong>
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    If your Image Get search comes back with a Not In Archive result, this
    indicates that an Archival Master file has not been uploaded for the given
    Image ID. However, this does not indicate whether or not derivatives of the
    Service Master (S File - cropped, srgb tif). have been uploaded. To check
    for other derivatives of a file when no Archival Master is in the
    repository, point your browser to the image server:
    http://images.nypl.org/?id=57034976&amp;t=w&amp;d=0
</p><br>
<p class="H2 text-spacing">
    Retrieving Files
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    All requested images are set to Deliver by default. If you would like
    copies of the U and S files to be delivered to the Staff folder, press the
    Submit button at the bottom of the page.
</p><br>
<p align="center">
    <img class="img-fluid" src="images/image2.png"/>
</p><br>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    All requested files will be copied into the Staff folder on ICE
    (ice.repo.nypl.org/ifs/ice/Staff). It’s worth noting that all requested
    images will be delivered to the Staff folder without the option to cancel.
    If large number of files are requested, all other requests will queue up
    behind the large request. Other users of the system may have time-sensitive
    needs for file retrieval, so please be mindful.
</p><br>
<p class="H2 text-spacing">
    Image Get as Repo Check Tool
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    Image Get was created primarily as a tool to provide Repository file
    retrieval, but the information it provides in the process can be extremely
    useful as a limited Repository viewer in a quality control workflow.
</p><br>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    <strong>Types</strong>
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    While the Information displayed in the Types field is relatively limited,
    it can provide clues as to what and when files have been uploaded to a
    particular Image ID. This
    <a
        href="https://confluence.nypl.org/display/DIG/Derivatives+for+Reflective+and+Transmissive+Media+Digitization"
    >
        comprehensive index for all derivative types
    </a>
    saved to long-term Isilon storage can decode any derivative type mysteries.
    For instance, if you see a d derivative in your Image Get results, you’ll
    know that a MrSID file was uploaded for the Image ID in question (MrSID was
    phased out of DIU production in 2010 and replaced by jp2 for deep zoom).
</p><br>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    <strong>Derivative Type Count</strong>
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    Command+F (Ctrl+F) is your friend here. If you’re repo checking files that
    have only been uploaded once, then you should be able to count on
    derivative type consistency for all requested files. This means you should
    be able to verify that all derivatives have been uploaded by searching for
    the expected number of derivatives to verify a complete upload after
    requesting all Image IDs on a work order. Image Get displays derivative
    type counts in parentheses, so a command+F search of “(8)” should count
    complete uploads for rights restricted material and a search of “(11)”
    should count complete uploads for public domain material.
</p><br>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    <strong>Pixel Dimensions</strong>
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    Command+F (Ctrl+F) can also be used to check the number of archival master
    files from a given Image Get request if all U files are identical in pixel
    dimensions. Otherwise, this information is useful for determining the
    camera used or whether or not the master files have been cropped before
    upload.
</p><br>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    <strong>Public Domain</strong>
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    If Q, V, and G derivatives are available for a given Image ID, the MMS item
    record for that capture has been given a rights profile with either a
    public domain, presumed public domain, or a creative commons license
    designation. High resolution downloads are freely available through Digital
    Collections for these images.
</p><br>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    <strong>Overwrites</strong>
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    If there are two or more instances of any derivative type in the Image Get
    search results, that particular derivative has been overwritten with a
    newer version. The Repository is locked for all intents and purposes, so
    every version of every derivative type that has ever been uploaded should
    still be available in the database. You won’t be able to see the older
    version in Image Get, but this can be useful information if a file is
    accidentally overwritten and a repository developer is called in to revert
    to the original versions of each overwritten derivative.
