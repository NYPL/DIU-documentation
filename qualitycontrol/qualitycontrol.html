    <strong>Summary</strong>
    - This document provides an overview and step-by-step walkthrough of the
    quality control process after imaging is complete. The quality control
    process happens after processed files have been uploaded to a shared
    working space server (currently ICE, or Isilon Cluster E) and before ingest
    into the repository. The process ensures that processed files meet minimum
    viable imaging specifications, files have been properly formed for long
    term storage, and images have been named so as to correctly match metadata.
    Imaging specifications are based on the FADGI four star guidelines outlined

    The vast majority of still image digitization at New York Public Library
    consists of reflective imaging whereby a light source is directed at an
    object and the light reflected off the object is captured by the camera.
    The alternative, transmissive imaging, is a digitization process whereby
    light transmits through translucent objects such as negatives, glass
    plates, and microfilm before being captured by the camera. The current
    quality control checklist for transmissive media can be seen

<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    <strong>Process Description</strong>
    - The quality control process is a team effort that requires contributions
    from all Collections Photographers. The process is maintained and organized
with the    <a href="https://trello.com/b/Ugdq9vU2/diu-workflow">DIU Workflow</a>
    Trello board. Every project, exhibition, or public order is broken down
    into discrete units or items with a corresponding work order. In other
    words, each public order or volume of a set or box of a collection or
    exhibition grouping is reflected by its own Trello card and MMS work order.
    A link to the relevant work order is available on every Trello card. Each
    Trello card is placed on the board according to the item’s status in the
    digitization process. As materials are received by the DIU, cards are added
    to the Materials Received list. Public orders are added directly to either
    the SASB Public Orders list or the LSC Public Orders list. When a project
    is assigned to a photographer and a workstation, the card is moved to the
    relevant workstation list and the photographer is added to the card. Once
    imaging is complete and processed files have been uploaded to the working
    space server, the card is moved to the bottom of the QC list
    (time-sensitive projects, such as public orders and exhibitions, can be
    placed at the top of the QC list). As photographers complete a session and
    add their cards to the QC list, the next step is to take a card from the
    top of the QC list and perform quality control on another photographer’s
    work. Sharing the quality control process has many advantages including
    impartiality, a shared workload, a view into another photographer’s output
    and techniques, a close look at other materials being digitized, and an
    encounter with the scope of the larger project of digitization at the
    library.

    Reflective Imaging QC Workflow Walkthrough
</p><br>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    1. After completing a work order and adding a card to the bottom of the QC
    list in Trello, take a card from the top of the QC list from another
    photographer and open the work order and session folder on the server.
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    2. Open session folder and begin by noting number of captures. Compare to
    number of captures on work order. There should be an S file (Service File -
    tif file in srgb color space cropped just beyond the edge of the material
    for the web) and a U file (Uncropped Master - tif file with embedded custom
    camera profile uncropped and an item level color control target included)
    for every capture, so there should always be an even number of files in a
    session folder. If number of captures is odd or if there are fewer captures
    than on work order, then captures are missing - leave a note in Trello for
    the photographer at this point. Check first and last Capture Sequence
    number on work order and first and last filename in folder to make sure
    files are named correctly. Check out of sequence IDs individually. Checking
    Image IDs is incredibly important so as not to mistakenly overwrite other
    captures. (Tip: use “home” and “end” keys on keyboard to quickly jump to
    the top or bottom of window/list or within a work order - to avoid
    scrolling)
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    3. Switch to icon view and increase thumbnail size to maximum, then adjust
    window to display two columns of captures using “Clean Up By &gt; Name”
    option in finder settings. Scroll through images and look for missing
    crops. Note missing crops in Trello.
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    4. Scroll through images and check to make sure images are in order,
    comparing with work order if necessary. For full book scans, verify there
    are no missing pages by looking at every page number. There may be a need
    to compare to the object itself, if there are no page numbers. For work
    orders with multiple objects, verify that the beginning and end of each
    object aligns with work order. If there are page number anomalies, leave a
    note in Trello for the photographer.
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    5. Scroll through images and check that opaque objects have been
    photographed on grey seamless, translucent objects photographed on white or
    off-white, tipped-in letters photographed on neutral matte board, and book
    scanner images have black background. Note any images that appear to be on
    the wrong background in Trello.
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    6. Scroll through images and do a cursory exposure, color, and composition
    check. Look for even exposure across the session. Icon view in finder is a
    good method for catching missing lens cast corrections (corners will be
    dark). Predictable red and green shifts, especially on full book scans,
    should be sent back for reprocessing. Object should fill frame unless
    otherwise explicitly stated at beginning of project.
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    7. Check that all U files are oriented correctly. There are a lot of
    judgement calls to be made in this area, so a conversation may be
    necessary. However, the majority of cases are easy to spot and involve U
    files being processed with the wrong orientation.
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    8. Inverted images, such as black and white negatives and microfilm should
    be reinverted for the web and repository. Black and white negatives and
    microfilm should be processed out as positives (both S &amp; U files).
    Transparencies should be captured and archived to match their original
    positive state. Inverted positive prints (such as photostats) should remain
    true to the original with reversed values.
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    9. Open 5-10 U files and 1 S file at random per session in Photoshop and
    check for the following:
</p>
<dl class="row text-large text-spacing tab">
  <dt class="col-sm-3">ICC Profile</dt>
  <dd class="col-sm-9"><p>Embedded camera profile for U files and srgb profile for S
    files (S file can be closed at this point)</p></dd>
  <dt class="col-sm-3">Focus</dt>
  <dd class="col-sm-9">
    <p>Even focus across object including center and all four corners</p>
  </dd>
  <dt class="col-sm-3">Exposure</dt>
  <dd class="col-sm-9"><p>White point should hit 240 in RGB values (+ or - 3 points),
    check that highlights do not cause color information to be clipped in any
    channel, book cradle shots evenly lit across page (no highlights near
    gutter), no distracting shadows or dark patches on object, object is evenly
    lit</p></dd>
  <dt class="col-sm-3">Neutral Balance</dt>
  <dd class="col-sm-9"><p>Middle grey values should be the same across all three
    RGB channels. When using a Golden Thread target, either patch 15 should
    read 130 across all three channels or patch 16 should read 96 across all
    three channels (+ or - 1 point difference across each channel). Checking
    the neutral balance is best done at 100% and using the eyedropper tool with
    the sample size set to 11 by 11 Average. If there is a big jump in point
    differences between channels, such as a 4 point difference among individual
    channels, the neutral balance may not have carried forward in the Capture
    One session and/or may need to be adjusted and reprocessed. Exceptions can
    be made for book scanner images due to difficulty in matching color across
    two camera systems.</p></dd>
  <dt class="col-sm-3">Color</dt>
  <dd class="col-sm-9">
    <p>Ensure that color is neutral and consistent across session. Pay
    close attention to any suspicion that a shot may be too red or green.
    Compare with original if necessary to verify. Open 4-6 pages in succession
    for full books scans and compare captures for opposing pages by displaying
    together. Any noticeable red/green shift should be noted in Trello and sent
    back to photographer for rebalancing. Assist photographer with
    troubleshooting, correcting inconsistent exposures before adjusting color
    balance.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt class="col-sm-3">Composition</dt>
  <dd class="col-sm-9">
    <p>Object fills the frame (unless shooting conventions for a
    project have determined otherwise - please ask photographer in Trello about
    this if need be), evenly lit complete target in every shot along edge of
    frame - at same height as the object</p>
  </dd>
  <dt class="col-sm-3">Moire</dt>
  <dd class="col-sm-9">
    <p>Check for moire - especially likely with halftone reproductions,
    etchings, crayon lithography, or any other mechanical print process with
    tightly hatched lines. (sometimes apparent with certain types of fabric
    samples as well)</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    10. After files have been checked and any issues resolved by the
    photographer, sessions need to be renamed with work order Image IDs. If
    Image IDs weren’t pre-populated, click
    
        <u><span class="teal grey" >Populate image_ids for everything on order</span>
    </u>
at the top of the work order. After Image IDs have been populated, click    <u><span class="teal grey">Copy all Capture IDs</span></u> to copy the work order IDs in sequence to the
    clipboard. Then, open Terminal and type “renamer” and press return. The
    script will prompt you for a directory to rename. Drag your server session
    folder into the Terminal window and press return. When prompted for Image
    IDs, press Command+V to paste Image IDs from the clipboard into Terminal
    and then press return. The script will rename files from Capture Sequence
    number to Image ID.
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    11. Rename server session folder to begin and end with X. Make sure there
    are no spaces in the folder name. A chron job will grab these files and
    move them to the rtg (ready to go) folder for overnight derivative creation
    in the Image Processor and move everything into the repository. If you’re
    working on a public order or another time-sensitive project, you can use
    rsync to move files into nfs://ice.repo.nypl.org/ifs/ice/rtg for immediate
    processing.
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    12. Move the Trello card into the Repo Check list, which will alert the
    photographer that files have been uploaded and will soon be ready for
    repository check.

    Vendor and Other External Digitization Quality Control
</p><br>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    Quality control of vendor digitization is an inherently different process
    than that done in-house. With still image digitization, items sent out to
    vendors tend to be stably-bound volumes that are being digitized strictly
    for access to the information in the volumes and often to achieve a
    full-text searchable PDF as endpoint. The image quality standards in this
    situation are less strict than our in-house preservation-quality standards.
    However, we do send out manuscripts and microfilm as well, and these
    collections provide their own challenges when digitized in bulk through a
    vendor. Our Mass Digitization Coordinator is still developing the workflow
    for these collections, but the specifications sent to vendors are listed
    below in the meantime.
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    Manuscripts and Microfilm
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    File Organization and Naming:
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    Files will be organized into a hierarchical directory format based on item,
    volume, or other logical unit of separation. Files will be named in
    sequential order, with file names corresponding to file organization. NYPL
    will provide directory structure and file naming conventions for vendor to
    adhere to.
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    Preservation master filenames (uncropped), must contain a “u” and service
    filenames (cropped), must contain an “s”.
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    Filenames must have the proper .tif extension.
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    File and directory names may not contain the following: spaces, special
    characters.
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    Each preservation master file must have a corresponding service file, and
    vice-versa. There must be the same number of images per object in both the
    preservation master and service file directories. Oversize materials, such
    as fold out maps, will be imaged separately and placed in a separate
    directory, with their placement within the original object noted with an
    image placeholder.
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    File Format Specifications for Manuscripts:
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    Vendor will create two file types: preservation master file (uncropped) and
    service file (cropped). Both files will follow the conventions and
    technical specifications of the uncompressed TIFF file format. One file
    will be delivered per page captured.

    Technical Metadata:
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    Technical metadata must be embedded into the image file according to the
    EXIF standard. Technical metadata should not be removed from files when
    creating derivatives. When using software to process files, ensure that any
    options to remove EXIF metadata are off.
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    File Delivery:
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    Files must be delivered on hard drives formatted for interoperability
    between Mac OSx and Windows operating systems. Recommended hard drive
    formatting is exFAT.
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    Files must be delivered with checksum manifests at the directory level. The
    purpose of image file checksums is to ensure that items are transferred
    safely throughout the entire chain of custody, and to ensure their
    long-term preservation. NYPL recommends using the BagIt file packaging
    format:
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BagIt">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BagIt
    </a>
    and creating “bags” for each directory containing images. If vendor is
    unable to utilize the BagIt packaging format, a spreadsheet with file names
    and corresponding checksums will be satisfactory.
</p>
<p class="text-large text-spacing">
    Delivered files must not include Thumbs.db, .DS_Store, and other hidden
    system files.
