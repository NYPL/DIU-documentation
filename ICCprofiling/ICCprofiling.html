<p>
    Within our Capture One software, under the BASE CHARACTERISTICS tool, there
    is a drop-down menu that allows us to choose an ICC Profile.
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img
        width="243"
        height="76"
        src="images/image17.png"
    />
</p>
<p>
    The chosen profile, in this case Flash, is specific to the Phase One back
    model being used.
</p>
<p>
    An ICC profile is responsible for interpreting the raw capture data
    streaming off a digital back’s sensor. It shapes a capture’s tonal and
    color range, and the manner by which all captured tones and colors relate
    to one another. We can say that the ICC profiles pre-stocked within Capture
One are “canned” because they are for optimized for specific digital back    <strong>models</strong> (P40+, P45, P65, IQ180, IQ3); however, these
profiles are not optimized for the specific digital back    <strong>units</strong> we are working with. Since these canned profiles
    perform, at best, a generalized interpretation of sensor data, our
    real-world results are compromised. Colors can shift away from accurate,
    tones can lose their neutrality, contrast can be elevated, and even focus
    can appear softened.
</p>
<p>
    By replacing the canned ICC profiles with in-house, custom-made ICC
    profiles, we are able to generate profiles that relate to the specific
    digital back, lens and lighting combinations present in each bay. In other
    words, instead of using a canned profile for an IQ180, we are able to
    create a profile for the specific IQ180 back residing in Bay 4 (serial
    number FP030582), its Schneider lens, and its four Profoto strobe light
    source.
</p>
<p>
    Our own custom-made profile will be found within the same drop-down menu:
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img
        width="262"
        height="76"
        src="images/image10.png"
    />
</p>
<p>
    By using a standardized system from bay to bay to generate custom profiles,
    we not only optimize results from each station, but optimize the results
    from the studio as a whole. The desire is to have capture systems in place
    that interpret sensor data similarly. A project begun in Bay 1,
    theoretically, can then be finished in Bay 6. The results should closely
    match.
</p>
<p>
    By the way, ICC means International Color Consortium.
</p>
<p align="center" class="h3">
    Step One: Creating the ICC Profile Target Image
</p>
<p>
    To begin, we need to image the X-Rite Digital ColorChecker SG Card.
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img
        width="419"
        height="295"
        src="images/image6.png"
    />
</p>
<p>
    To have standardized results from bay to bay we need a repeatable set-up**:
</p>
<p>
    Digital back — 30 inches above copy stand surface
</p>
<p>
    Lights — at 20 degrees
</p>
<p>
    — 56” from center (copy stand surface to light stand)
</p>
<p>
    — 36” above copy stand surface
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img
        width="470"
        height="258"
        src="images/image8.jpg"
    />
</p>
<p>
    <strong>*</strong>
    This set-up is applicable for Bays 1, 3, 5, and 6. The IQ3 in Bay 4 will
    use four lights at their standard height and distance. The BC100 has its
    own methodology.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>**Please note</strong>
    , that since first creating this document back in 2015 some things have
    changed. One change is our conclusion that a repeatable set-up, as
    described above, is unnecessary among applicable bays. Best is to capture
    the SG Card using a set-up common to the bay in question, in other words,
    an average set-up for an average project. The lights shouldn’t be too high
    or too low, too angled, or too close to the table.
</p>
<p>
    Start Capture One and set the PROCESS RECIPES to U Files. Make sure the ICC
Profile for the PROCESS RECIPE is set for    <strong>Embed color profile</strong>.
</p>
<p>
Go to BASE CHARACTERISTICS &gt; ICC Profile &gt; Effects &gt;    <strong>No color correction</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Focus on chart and create an LCC.
</p>
<p>
    Photograph the chart so that the central white square comes to 241 (E5) and
    neutralize on the middle grey (H5). If Capture One adjustments are needed
    to attain the 241 white-point, use the LEVELS highlight slider.
</p>
<p>
    Crop the chart a hair more than size.
</p>
<p>
    Add <strong>-TARGET</strong> as a suffix to the name of the file.
</p>
<p>
    Process out the file.
</p>
<p>
    Quit Capture One.
</p>
<p align="center" class="h3">
    Step Two: Creating a Custom Profile Using basICColor input Software
</p>
<p>
    Before opening the basICColor input software, which will create our custom
    profiles, you’ll need to plug in the USB dongle for the software. It’s red!
</p>
<p>
    Start the software. Enlarge the window to fill screen.
</p>
<p>
    The screen will appear, in part, as such:
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img
        width="470"
        height="297"
        src="images/image16.png"
    />
</p>
<p>
Under <strong>Image</strong> click Select and navigate to your    <strong>TARGET</strong> image and choose.
</p>
<p>
Under <strong>Reference</strong> click Select and navigate to file    <strong> DCSG BC.txt</strong> and choose.
</p>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td width="2" height="0">
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
            </td>
            <td>
                <img
                    width="470"
                    height="244"
                    src="images/image22.png"
                />
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<br clear="ALL"/>
<p align="center">
    <img
        width="470"
        height="157"
        src="images/image14.png"
    />
</p>
<p>
    Your <strong>TARGET</strong> image will appear with a superimposed grid.
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img
        width="470"
        height="283"
        src="images/image3.png"
    />
</p>
<p>
    Hold down the shift key as you grab the upper left corner square and move
    the the upper left box of the grid over the upper left white square of the
    ColorChecker chart. The bounding box will turn green when properly
    positioned. While still holding down the shift key, grab the lower right
    corner and do the same. All peripheral boxes should turn green. One might
    need to adjust the corners independently, without the shift-key activated,
    to secure the proper outcome. All green is preferred, but a yellow bounding
    box here and there can be sufficient. None of the bounding boxes can appear
    red.
</p>
<p>
    If a first attempt is unsuccessful, restart the program and try anew.
</p>
<p>
    Here’s a good result:
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img
        width="470"
        height="404"
        src="images/image15.png"
    />
</p>
<p>
    Then under Filename name your profile. Our convention is as follows at this
    point in time:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>PhaseOneBackModel-NYPL_Bay#_Flash_YYYYMM</strong>
</p>
<p>
    e.g., <strong>PhaseOneP45-NYPL_Bay1_Flash_201807</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Our backs as of today (7/2018):
</p>
<p>
    PhaseOneIQ3100MP-
</p>
<p>
    PhaseOneIQ180-
</p>
<p>
    PhaseOneP65-
</p>
<p>
    PhaseOneP45-
</p>
<p>
    PhaseOneP40+-
</p>
<p>
It’s very important to follow this convention as such, especially the    <strong>PhaseOneBackModel-</strong> part, in order for proper
    viewing/accessibility within the Capture One application.
</p>
<p>
    Under Spectral conversion<strong> </strong>choose &gt; Illuminant &gt; CIE
    Standard Illuminants &gt; <strong>CIE_D50</strong>.
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img
        width="470"
        height="297"
        src="images/image13.png"
    />
</p>
<p>
    Click Create ICC profile(s) at the bottom of the window. The profile will
    be automatically stored within the computer’s Library folder &gt; ColorSync
    &gt; Profiles and made accessible to the Capture One program through the
    dropdown ICC menu within the Base Characteristics tool.
</p>
<p align="center" class="h3">
    Step Three: Creating the ICC Profile Verification Image
</p>
<p>
    Start Capture One and set the PROCESS RECIPES to U Files. Make sure the ICC
    Profile for the PROCESS RECIPE is set for <strong>ProPhoto</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    Go to BASE CHARACTERISTICS &gt; ICC Profile. In the dropdown menu you’ll
    find the ICC profile just created. Choose this profile and capture another
    image of the ColorChecker chart using the previously made LCC.
</p>
<p>
    Adjust the white square (E5) to 241 and assure the neutrality of the middle
    grey (H5).
</p>
<p>
    No need to crop.
</p>
<p>
    Add <strong>-VERIFY</strong> as a suffix to the name of the file.
</p>
<p>
    Process out the file.
</p>
<p align="center" class="h3">
    Step Four: Verifying the Custom Profile Using IQ-Analyzer Software
</p>
<p>
    Before opening the IQ-Analyzer software, which will verify our custom
    profiles, you’ll need to plug in the USB dongle for the software. It’s
    blue!
</p>
<p>
    Once the program is loaded, choose <strong>Color</strong> from the dropdown
    menu in the upper left corner.
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img
        width="469"
        height="339"
        src="images/image21.png"
    />
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img
        width="244"
        height="424"
        src="images/image12.png"
    />
</p>
<p>
You’ll then load the <strong>-VERIFY</strong> image by clicking on the    <strong>+</strong> icon found on the left-middle edge of the window.
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img
        width="199"
        height="397"
        src="images/image9.png"
    />
</p>
<p>
    Push <strong>Start</strong> to begin the analysis.
</p>
<p>
    Your results might look something like this:
</p>
<table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center">
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td width="2" height="0">
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
            </td>
            <td>
                <img
                    width="470"
                    height="286"
                    src="images/image19.png"
                />
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<br clear="ALL"/>
<p>
    By clicking on the small right-pointing <strong>arrow</strong> in the
    upper-right corner, two sets of info palettes will appear. The first line
    of the second palette shows the <strong>Delta E</strong> measurements that
    are most relevant to the work at hand. In the example below we see a Delta
    E of .9 for the neutral category and 2.2 for the color category, resulting
    in a total Delta E of 1.7.
</p>
<p>
    This is a very fine result.
</p>
<p align="center"
    <img
        width="315"
        height="472"
        src="file://localhost/private/var/folders/q_/x0bx9qzx19g3jw215rsrxsh40000gp/T/TemporaryItems/msoclip/0/clip_image030.gif"
    />
</p>
<p>
    By exploring the following dropdown, we can visualize the results in a
    variety of manners.
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img
        width="470"
        height="217"
        src="images/image5.png"
    />
</p>
<p>
    For instance:
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img
        width="469"
        height="356"
        src="images/image18.png"
    />
</p>
<p>
    And:
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img
        width="470"
        height="357"
        src="images/image20.png"
    />
</p>
<p>
    Click on the rotate and zoom buttons and use the cursor to move the 3D
    model about.
</p>
<p>
    And finally these last two, both of which can be rotated and zoomed as
    well:
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img
        width="471"
        height="357"
        src="images/image7.png"
    />
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img
        width="469"
        height="356"
        src="images/image4.png"
    />
</p>
<p>
    At this time it’s a good idea to export a report for future reference. This
    will come handy when running a verification using this same profile at some
    later date, say six months down the road. One can then ascertain whether
    the profile in question has remained stable over time. To create this
    report, click on the <strong>Export</strong> button in the lower-right
    corner of the window. Please note that this report, along with others that
    are automatically generated, are stored in the folder containing the
    original <strong>VERIFY</strong> tif.
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img
        width="470"
        height="227"
        src="images/image1.png"
    />
</p>
<p>
    Once you verify that the new profile is a keeper, you can transfer it from
    its current Color Sync location to a subfolder located within the Capture
    One application itself. This will help create a more stable operating
    environment for the profile to function within.
</p>
<p>
    The following directory tree will lead you to your profile’s new home:
</p>
<p align="center">
    <img
        width="470"
        height="14"
        src="images/image2.png"
    />
</p>
<p>
    Lastly, it can be helpful to the group to share all operative profiles
    among all workstations. This will allow for the seamless processing at any
    workstation of session folders and EIP files, regardless of the bay in
    which they originated. Be sure, likewise, to store a copy of each new
    profile on the server to help facilitate this share and to back up the work
    done.
